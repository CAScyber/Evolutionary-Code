• A piece of code that transforms and evolves as anyone adds to it, simply measured by systems theory.
<br>
• The idea is simple. Start a piece of code, and let it transform. In whateverways, doing whateverthings. A little piece here and there, with ad infinitum community contributions. 
<br>
• First, what code? HTML and JS will be our code. You can go off and do what you wish. HTML and JS seems like an easy enough starting point.
<br>
• What's systems theory. The gist of it is, perfection is called systems that engage in complex adaption. It is a sort of equilibrium state that indicates the health of the multivariable system. If all pieces, or contributions, work, then we hope to reach a CAS that functions, grows, etc. It is a bit like a quasi cybernetics. 
<br>
•Just go to the html file and innovate, Contribute, hack.
