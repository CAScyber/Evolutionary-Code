# Evolutionary-Code
A piece of code that transforms and evolves as anyone adds to it, simply measured by systems theory.
<br>
# The idea is simple. Start a piece of code, and let it transform. In whateverways, doing whateverthings. A little piece here and there, with ad infinitum community contributions. 
<br>
# First, what code? JS will be our code.
<br>
# What's systems theory. The gist of it is, perfection is called systems that engage in complex adaption. It is a sort of equilibrium state that indicates the health of the multivariable system. If all pieces, or contributions, work, then we hope to reach a CAS that functions, grows, etc. It is a bit like a quasi cybernetics.
